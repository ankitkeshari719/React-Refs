<b>React Refs and the DOM</b>

<p>Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.</p>

<b>There are a few good use cases for refs:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.</li>
    <li>Triggering imperative animations.</li>
    <li>Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.</li>
</ul>
